Addition by @PaulskPt 2022-03-16
Created folder: tiny-snake-doc and added a photograph of the hardware setup
Modified the snake-game for two different groups of displays: oled (i2) and tft (spi)
While the 'Play Shield' seems to be out of production / out of the market,
the snake game has been adapted to use external buttons.
