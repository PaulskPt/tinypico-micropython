Addition by @PaulskPt 2022-03-16
Created folder: tiny-snake-doc and added a photograph of the hardware setup
Modified the snake-game for two different groups of displays: oled (i2) and tft (spi)
While the production of the 'Play Shield' has been discontinued,
the snake game has been adapted to use external buttons.
There is now a TinyPICO EXPLORER SHIELD but this example snake-game is not intended for the new shield.
