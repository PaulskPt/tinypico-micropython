TinyPICO MicroPython Firmware
=============================

In this folder you'll fine the lest MicroPython firmware I am shipping on production boards.

Eventually you'll be able to download the latest MicroPython TinyPICO specific firmware from http://micropython.org/download, but until per board firmware is available you can use this instead.

All TinyPICO firmware here includes both the TinyPICO Helper and Dotstar libraries frozen into the firmware.
